#aGHC
a GitHub Client built for iPhone

##so what is it?
My individual senior project. Designed originally to be a fully functioning GitHub client for iOS implementing as many features of the GitHub API as I can build.

##Features?
I have a goal of enabling edits to repositories as well as commiting those changed back into the repository. We call can dream, right?

##Bugs
A lot.

##Current Status?
I don't even think I'd consider it an alpha product at this point. There's far too much I want to implement still.

##License
My shit is licensed under the MIT license. But I'm using an insane amount of other libraries, some actually using and some just for exploration and tinkering, so see LICENSE for full details.
